# Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG)

DDPG used for solving Pendulum problem from OpenAI Gym.

Available implementations: PyTorch, Keras.

Keras versions is taken directly from Keras documentation pages: https://keras.io/examples/rl/ddpg_pendulum/.

ddpg_torch.py is my attempt of porting the Keras version to PyTorch.
